This is a program that applies a semi-supervised algorithm for optical character structure recognition to a small hand-drawn dataset.

You'll need to download three files:
* data.zip
* pickles.zip
* train.zip

Unzip them in the usual way and place them (as directories) in the working directory.

You'll also need the following dependencies:
* Standard numpy and scipy distributions
* OpenCV2 for Python
* Scikit-Learn 0.17

You can then test it out for yourself by running:

`python chemtype.py`
